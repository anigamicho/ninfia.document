ANDI POKEMON MOVESET 1.0 (AMSE)

    This tools for editing a moveset on pokemon BW and BW2 games
    With easy without editing manually via HEX. But this tool 
    Not able direct to added new slot move. If you want added
    new slot moves, you must added it manually via hex editor.
    before that you must excrating container into small pieces,
    after that you can added new slot moves, after that you can
    re-pack them, and you can load that narc file via this tool.
    AMSE able load modified slot moves, since AMSE is looking
    offset so is not worried if moveset in every pokemon is 
    different.
